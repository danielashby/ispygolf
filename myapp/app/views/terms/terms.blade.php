         <strong>Membership Terms             </strong><br>
        The iSpyGolf Exclusive membership can be purchased online or registered via a specific landing page (details provided with the relevant promotion), where a card has been provided by a third party or at an event.        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Membership Offers &amp; Benefits</strong><br>
        iSpyGolf Exclusive members [&quot;card holders&quot;] receive an iSpyGolf card.

Benefits may only be claimed when booking DIRECTLY with the venue or via ispygolf.com and can not be claimed in conjunction with another offer or when booking via a third party tour operator. Card holders should notify the venue that they are an iSpyGolf card holder in advance of their arrival and present their iSpyGolf card on arrival or check-in in order to claim their benefit. 
<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Disclaimer</strong><br>
        While we endeavour to ensure all participating venues honour their obligation to provide the offer/benefit as advertised, iSpyGolf Ltd cannot be held responsible for a venue’s failure or refusal to do so.  Any participating venue providing an offer or benefit to iSpyGolf card holders must agree to the separate venue terms and conditions outlined <span class="homepgtext_highlight"><a href="/globalTBs/plus_terms.php?keepThis=false&TB_iframe=false&height=550&width=510">here.</a></span>
